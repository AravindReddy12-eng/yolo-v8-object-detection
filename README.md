# <span style="color:deepskyblue"> Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with YOLOv8 & Streamlit </span>

This repository is an extensive open-source project showcasing the seamless integration of **object detection and tracking** using **YOLOv8** (object detection algorithm), along with **Streamlit** (a popular Python web application framework for creating interactive web apps). It is a user-friendly and customizable interface designed to detect and track objects in real-time video streams from sources such as RTSP, UDP, and YouTube URLs, as well as static videos and images.







### Detection on RTSP

- Select the RTSP stream button
- Enter the rtsp url inside the textbox and hit `Detect Objects` button

### Detection on YouTube Video URL

- Select the source as YouTube
- Copy paste the url inside the text box.
- The detection/segmentation task will start on the YouTube video url



This project is  demonstration of integrating various technologies, including:

- Streamlit
- YoloV8
- Object-Detection on Images And Live Video Streams
- Python-OpenCV
